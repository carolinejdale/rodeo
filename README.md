# caro.rodeo

Hello, this is the readme file for my personal website.

## My plans
+ Create a projects page with examples of recent work.
+ Write a little about each project - the tools I used, skills I picked up and lessons learned. 
+ Create a bio page.
+ Create a CV (web and PDF versions).
+ Add a links page.
+ Update index.html and styles.css with an improved layout once content is in place.
