Hello, this is the readme file for my personal website.

## To do
+ Create a projects page with examples of recent work:
    + Web Application Server-Side Foundations coursework;
    + freeCodeCamp projects;
    + Todo Today.
+ Write a little about each project - the tools I used, skills I picked up and lessons learned. 
+ Create a CV and/or bio page (web and PDF/print versions).
+ Add a links page.
+ Update index.html and styles.css with an improved layout once content is in place.
