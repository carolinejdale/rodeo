# Todo ✿ Today
A jS to-do list.
      
## About this app
Does every fledgling developer need to make a to-do list app at some point? Apparently, but that's not why I made this one. I'm a stationery and productivity app freak, but I'm cursed to never to find anything cute enough for my liking. I wanted something that looked bright, fun and non-punishingly ephemeral to keep open in a web browser at work.

Naturally, I also implemented a custom icon to match the updated CSS featuring my favourite symbol (Black Florette! Who else? ✿)


## Development notes
 This project was one of my first attempts to familiarise myself with JavaScript, so I used <a href="https://codepen.io/JohnPaulFich/pen/MXmzzM">this CodePen</a> by John Fichera (<a href="https://codepen.io/JohnPaulFich">@JohnPaulFich</a>) as a starting point, built out an interface I liked, then started tweaking the jS.

### Tools and skills 
This project was my first exposure to a number of concepts, including:
+ event listeners
+ nested functions
+ arrays
+ DOM manipulation
+ custom favicon

### To do
+ Fix favicon link
+ Restructure project folder

### Future plans
 Any additional iterations will likely be focused on data persistence.

### Resources
+ <a href="https://codepen.io/JohnPaulFich/pen/MXmzzM">Todo List, Plain JS</a> by John Fichera (<a href="https://codepen.io/JohnPaulFich">@JohnPaulFich</a>)

## Updates
