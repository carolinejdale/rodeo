# Prana
## Instructions
Breathe along with the animation for as long as feels good.

__WARNING:__ Prana was not designed with clinical use in mind. Please consult your doctor to learn if and which breathwork practices may be appropriate for you.
      
## About this app
Prana is a small self-initiated project I designed for myself. I wanted an app I could flick over to when I wanted to catch a moment's breath, or to play in the background when I need something to ground me. It is based on the yogic principle of pranayama, or controlled breathing, although my deployment of it here is a gross simplification of the techniques and knowledge available in this ancient Indian practice.

## Development notes

This project was an opportunity for me to play with: 
 + implementing custom keystroke events;
 + jS libraries;
 + CSS animations;
 + customising popup events;
 + implementing light/dark mode;
 + media queries;
 + creating & toggling custom views in CSS and JS.

Features I have included in the original release are in alignment with what I personally desired in such an app:

+ keystroke option toggling;
+ 'day'/'night' modes;
+ a simple 'About' popup (using the [popup-js library](http://popup.js.org));
+ a very clean interface with option for 'Zen' mode to minimise visual distraction.

Future releases may include:
+ different techniques (e.g. ladder breath, 4:6 breath);
+ breath counter;
+ timer feature.
