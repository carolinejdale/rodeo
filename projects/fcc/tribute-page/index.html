    Did somebody say "Condiments?!" What could we love more than those lovable bottled ingredients. They are Friends of the Sandwich.

<p>You can even look up condiments up on <a id="tribute-link" href="http://www.wikipedia.org" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>. You will have to search for it yourself though as we don't intend to coddle you.</p>

 This is what is known about <strong>condiments</strong> to date:
      <ul>
        <li>Friends of the Sandwich</li>
        <li>Some are Japanese
        <li>Usually contain multiple ingredients
         <li>Mayonnaise is one of em
        <li>Can come in a jar but that is <em>not legally binding</em> 
        <li>No new Condiments of Note have been invented in over 50 years (too hard)
        </ul>
